# CTF_Toolkit

CTF toolkit or Capture the Flag toolkit , is a security project aka toolkit, which cascades all the important tools used during CTF under one roof and cascades them under one single platform running server. This way the CTF player can find all the tools under one place and thus it will be easier for him to perform in CTF rather than going on the internet and searching for each tool separatively.
The project is hosted on django with scripts written in python, frontend is made using html/css and javascript with atractive UI with help of several libraries eg. particles.js

How to use  ?

Simple download all the file and make sure you have django framework installed. 
Then open the manage.py file and write command py /manage.py runserver <server ip> --insecure 
This will in turn run the sever and you can copy the server on your Chrome, and voila, easy peasy. : )
